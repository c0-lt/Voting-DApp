## Disclaimer

Yes, you are right ! The frontend is really ugly and basic... I am a former backend developer (Python) and believe it or not, I have never learnt how to create a basic frontend. Even though it is ugly, it was really painful and a lot of work for me to come up with this. Not to mention learning React ðŸ˜±ðŸ¤¯.
